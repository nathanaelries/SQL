Below is a **template script** you can use to retrieve **Cost Threshold for Parallelism** and **Max Degree of Parallelism** (MAXDOP) settings on a SQL Server instance, along with **basic recommendations** based on the number of CPU cores detected. The second part of the script pulls CPU/memory info from `sys.dm_os_sys_info` to facilitate general guidelines. 

> **Note**: Parallelism settings can vary depending on workload type, NUMA configuration, query patterns, and other factors. The recommendations here are general starting points and should be tested or adjusted for your specific environment.

### Explanation of the Script

1. **`sys.configurations`**  
   - Stores server-level configurations. We filter on:
     - **`max degree of parallelism`**: Caps the number of CPU cores used by a parallel query.  
     - **`cost threshold for parallelism`**: The estimated sub-tree cost above which a query may go parallel.

2. **`sys.dm_os_sys_info`**  
   - Provides CPU and memory details:
     - **`cpu_count`**: Total logical CPU cores visible to SQL Server.  
     - **`hyperthread_ratio`**: Indicates if hyper-threading is in use (e.g., 2 on many Intel systems).  
     - **`physical_memory_kb`**: Amount of RAM installed on the server.

3. **Recommendations**  
   - **`SuggestedMaxDOP`**:
     - For small servers (\< 8 cores), you might set MAXDOP to the number of cores (or even 1 if the workload is extremely OLTP-heavy and you want to avoid parallel overhead).  
     - For bigger servers (8+ cores), a typical starting recommendation is `MAXDOP = 8`.  
     - Highly concurrent or heavy OLTP environments sometimes even lower it to 4 or less.  
     - BI/OLAP can benefit from higher parallelism, but it depends on concurrency, memory, and partitioning.  
   - **`SuggestedCostThreshold`**:
     - Default is 5, which is often too low on modern hardware.  
     - Many DBAs raise it to **25–50** as a general starting point.  
     - If you have large, complex queries (especially in data warehousing/analytics), you might go even higher (50–100).

### When to Use
- **Health Checks**: Part of routine server configuration reviews.  
- **Performance Tuning**: If you see excessive parallelism or CPU contention, adjusting these settings can help.  
- **Scaling Up**: When adding more CPUs or switching to a new hardware platform, re-check these settings.

### Best Practices & Caveats
1. **Test Before Production**  
   - Changes to parallelism settings can have a major impact on performance. Always test in a lower environment or during a maintenance window.

2. **NUMA Considerations**  
   - If your server uses Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA), you may want to set `MAXDOP` to the number of cores in a NUMA node or `<= 8`.  

3. **Mixed Workloads**  
   - If you have a mix of short OLTP queries and a few big reporting queries, you might choose a moderate `MAXDOP` but a higher `cost threshold for parallelism` so that only genuinely heavy queries go parallel.

4. **Regular Reassessment**  
   - Re-check these settings periodically (e.g., after hardware changes, major workload shifts, or SQL Server version upgrades).

**In summary**, this script lets you quickly **view** how parallelism is currently configured and provides **basic suggestions** for `MAXDOP` and `cost threshold for parallelism`. Always treat these suggestions as a **starting point** and tailor them to the specific demands and architecture of your SQL Server environment.
