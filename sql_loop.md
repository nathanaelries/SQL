The following script demonstrates how to iterate through a table row by row using a 
T-SQL cursor. It can be helpful when you must process each record individually due 
to business or technical constraints. However, if at all possible, try to use 
set-based SQL operations for better performance and maintainability.

    1. DECLARE CURSOR:
       - We declare a cursor named idCursor.
       - FAST_FORWARD: Optimizes the cursor for quick, forward-only scanning.

## When Might This Be Useful?

### 1. Processing Rows One at a Time (Row-by-Row Requirements)
- **External Calls:** If you must invoke a stored procedure or external system call for each row, you can’t do it easily in a single set-based statement.
- **Complex Business Logic:** Some business rules are inherently sequential (e.g., each record’s calculation depends on the previous record’s output).
- **Data Migration / Cleanup with Complex Dependencies:** Occasionally, data fixes or migrations need to handle tricky cross-row dependencies one by one.

### 2. Handling Small Data Sets
- If the table is small and performance is not a critical factor, a cursor can be a straightforward way to express “one-record-at-a-time” logic.

### 3. Readability for Iterative Processing
- A cursor can be more explicit than a clever `WHILE` loop with `MIN()` or an ad-hoc approach. It lets other developers immediately recognize row-by-row processing.

## Caveats & Best Practices

1. **Prefer Set-Based Approaches**  
   SQL is optimized for set operations. If you can perform an action in a single `UPDATE`, `INSERT`, or `DELETE` statement (possibly with joins or window functions), it will usually be faster and more maintainable.

2. **Choose the Right Cursor Options**  
   - **FAST_FORWARD**: Minimizes overhead if you’re only moving forward.  
   - **READ_ONLY**: If you don’t need to modify data via the cursor, read-only mode avoids unnecessary overhead.

3. **Be Mindful of Performance**  
   - Iterative (row-by-row) processing can be slow for large tables. If performance becomes an issue, investigate whether a set-based rewrite is possible.

4. **Clean Up**  
   - Always `CLOSE` and `DEALLOCATE` your cursor to release resources and avoid memory leaks.

**In Summary**, the above script demonstrates how to iterate through a table row by row using a T-SQL cursor. It can be helpful when you must process each record individually due to business or technical constraints. However, if at all possible, try to use set-based SQL operations for better performance and maintainability.
