Below is a **“missing indexes”** script you can add to your toolkit. Identifying potentially missing indexes often provides **quick wins** when it comes to **SQL Server performance**—especially for heavy OLTP or mixed workloads. After all, a well-chosen index can drastically reduce I/O and CPU usage for frequent queries.

> **Note**: Don’t blindly create every index this DMV suggests—review each recommendation for redundancy and potential overhead (e.g., slower writes, extra storage). But this is a **great** starting point to see where you might gain the most performance benefit quickly.

## Script: Identify Missing Indexes and Generate Recommendations

```sql
/*
    ================================================================================
    Script   : FindMissingIndexes
    Author   : [Your Name]
    Date     : [Date]
    Purpose  : 
        1. Uses the missing index DMVs (Dynamic Management Views) to identify 
           potentially beneficial indexes that don't currently exist.
        2. Shows the estimated improvement ("impact") and includes a basic CREATE INDEX script.

### How It Works

1. **DMVs Used**  
   - **`sys.dm_db_missing_index_details`**: Shows which columns in each table are needed for equality, inequality, and included columns.  
   - **`sys.dm_db_missing_index_group_stats`** and **`sys.dm_db_missing_index_groups`**: Store statistics such as the number of seeks, scans, and average query cost impact for those missing indexes.

2. **Weighted Improvement**  
   - We multiply `avg_total_user_cost` by `avg_user_impact` to get a rough measure of which missing indexes might bring the most overall benefit.

3. **Automatic Script Generation**  
   - The final column, `ProposedCreateIndex`, builds a **basic CREATE INDEX statement** that you can copy, inspect, and tweak.

### Key Columns in the Output

- **`DatabaseName`**: The database for which the missing index is suggested.  
- **`TableName`**: The table (or view) name from which columns are missing.  
- **`EqualityCols` & `InequalityCols`**: Which columns should be placed in the key portion of the index (first equality, then inequality).  
- **`IncludedCols`**: Columns recommended as included columns. Typically, these do not form part of the key.  
- **`UniqueCompiles`**, **`Seeks`**, **`Scans`**: Basic usage stats for how often queries referencing these columns have executed without an ideal index.  
- **`EstimatedBenefit`**: A heuristic measure of how much time might be saved by implementing this index, based on how expensive the related queries are and how often they run.  
- **`ProposedCreateIndex`**: An auto-generated “CREATE INDEX” statement.

### Usage Scenarios

- **Performance Triage**: When you suspect the server is slow due to missing or sub-optimal indexes, this is a quick way to see the biggest offenders.  
- **Proactive Maintenance**: Periodically review these DMVs to catch new or evolving query patterns in your workloads.  
- **Migration or New Deployment**: Right after a large data migration or application release, check if new queries are missing indexes.

### Best Practices & Recommendations

1. **Validate Before Creating**  
   - Check for **duplicate or overlapping** indexes you might already have.  
   - Consider whether a composite index might handle **both** the new suggestions and existing needs.

2. **Monitor Disk & Write Overhead**  
   - Each new index takes up **disk space** and can **slow down inserts/updates**. Always weigh the read-vs-write tradeoff.

3. **Don’t Rely Solely on DMVs**  
   - SQL Server’s suggestions can miss advanced indexing strategies (e.g., filtered indexes, columnstore indexes, etc.).  
   - For specialized workloads (like heavily partitioned tables or large data warehouses), you may need to analyze usage patterns more deeply.

4. **Rotate or Archive**  
   - The missing index DMVs reset every time SQL Server restarts or the database is detached. Keep that in mind if you’re doing longer-term trending.

5. **Always Test**  
   - Implement indexes in a non-production or staging environment first if possible. Evaluate query execution plans and performance improvements in real or near-real workloads.

**In summary**, this **Missing Indexes** script is a powerful tool for **quick performance tuning wins**. It helps sysadmins and DBAs discover what indexes SQL Server’s engine sees as beneficial, but always remember to **validate** and **prioritize** any recommended indexes before rolling them out to production.
